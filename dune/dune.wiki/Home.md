## Introduction

DUNE: Unified Navigational Environment is a runtime environment for
unmanned systems on-board software. It is used to write generic
embedded software at the heart of the system, e.g. code or control,
navigation, communication, sensor and actuator access, etc. It
provides an operating-system and architecture independent platform
abstraction layer, written in C++, enhancing portability among
different CPU architectures and operating systems.
