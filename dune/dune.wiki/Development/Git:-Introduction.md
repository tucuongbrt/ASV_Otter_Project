DUNE's repository is hosted using Git. You should learn to use the Git
client (or any other available front-end), studying the advantages and
limitations of the system before compromising any part of the
repository. A good Git book is available at http://git-scm.com/book

* Do not commit compiled files to the source tree. Exceptions to this
  rule are files supplied by third parties that cannot be easily
  compiled from source;

* Commit only the files that you have changed. Resist the temptation
  of commiting an entire directory, hoping for the best to happen;

* Commit changes with caution and conscience. Furthermore do not make
  any commits that you know will render the project in an uncompilable
  state;

* Never keep files checked out for long periods;

* Always update your working copy before starting work.
