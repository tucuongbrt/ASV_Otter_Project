# Obtaining the Source Code

## Unix Command Line

It's good practice to create a dedicated folder for DUNE's source code
and compiled binaries.

### Create a dedicated folder:

```sh
mkdir $HOME/dune
```

### Clone DUNE's repository from Github:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/LSTS/dune.git $HOME/dune/dune
```

After cloning DUNE's repository, the source code will be available in
$HOME/dune/dune
