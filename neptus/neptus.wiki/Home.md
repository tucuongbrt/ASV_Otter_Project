## Introduction

Neptus has been developed and thouroughly tested by LSTS for commanding and controlling fleets of unmanned vehicles. Neptus supports AUVs, UAVs, ROVs, ASVs and different types of non-actuated sensors. Operators not only can use Neptus to observe real-time data of networked vehicles but also to revise data from previous missions, plan and simulate future missions to be executed by one or several vehicles.
Neptus provides a comprehensive distributed environment where operators and vehicles can join in and leave the network as time floes. Operators are able to interact with a dynamic set of available assets as well as each other in real-time by commanding plans and receiving data from the network.
