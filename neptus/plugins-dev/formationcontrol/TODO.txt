- 	Popup window to display all connected vehicles and let one decide which to use for the controller.
-	Use local NED coordinate system centered in fish.
-	If the controller is running and an additional vehicle gets connectes, check the vehicle
	state and if it's not in FollowReference mode but in Service mode, then start it.
-	Substract PI from Beta to let vehicles reduce speed to keep distances.
